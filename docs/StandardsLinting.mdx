# Linting Standards

JavaScript based projects at Clarity Hub should use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to lint files.

See [eslint-config-clarity-hub](https://github.com/clarityhub/eslint-config-clarity-hub) for
a set of linting rules that Clarity Hub uses for Node and React projects.

## Linting Checks

Any Continuous Integration system should always run linting on push.

Additionally, projects should use [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) to run linting locally before
pushing to remote.
