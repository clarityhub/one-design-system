# Testing Standards

Clarity Hub projects should use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running unit tests.

Additional types of testing, might use tools outside of jest:

* Mutation testing – [Styker](https://stryker-mutator.io/)
* End-to-End testing - [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)

## Running Tests

Any Continuous Integration system should always run unit tests on push.

Additionally, projects should use [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) to run unit tests locally before
pushing to remote.

More complex tests such as End-to-End tests should run on deployment or nightly.
