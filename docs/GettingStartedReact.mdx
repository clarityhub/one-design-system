# React

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-web
npm i --save react react-dom prop-types @emotion/core @emotion/styled
```

## Initialize Styleguide

This will normalize your css and load in webfonts from Google.

```js
import '@clarityhub/unity-web/lib/init';
```

Simply use the above line in your entrypoint of your application (usually `index.js`).

## Icons

The prefered icon set to use is the one provided by Material UI:

```bash
npm i --save @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
```

Or, use the MDI icons:

```bash
npm i --save @mdi/js @mdi/react
```

These are not marked as peerDependencies since they are not actually
required to get the Unity Design System to run.
