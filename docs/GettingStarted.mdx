# Getting Started

The **Unity Design System** is split into multiple packages to make it easier to work with depending on your use-case.

## Installation

### unity-core

The unity-core packages contains colors, typography, spacing, and other utilities that can be used in any JavaScript environment.

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-core
```

### unity-web

The unity-web package uses React and Emotion to render components
and CSS. These are peer dependencies, so you will need to install them seperately
from the design system:

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-web
npm i --save react react-dom prop-types @emotion/core @emotion/styled
```

See [Getting Started React](#/packages-unity-core-src-getting-started-react) for more details

### unity-email

The unity-email package is for generating HTML emails from React.

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-email
```
