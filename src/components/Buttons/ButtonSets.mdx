# ButtonSets

A `ButtonSet` is used to group a set of action buttons together
and provide the appropriate spacing between them to make each button distinct, but
still visually grouped together.

## \<ButtonSet /\> component

```js
import { ButtonSet } from '@clarityhub/one/components/Buttons';
```

## Examples

### ButtonSet

<Playground>
    <Typography>Let's create a new user!</Typography>
    <ButtonSet>
        <Button>Cancel</Button>
        <Button type="primary">Create</Button>
    </ButtonSet>
    <br />
    <br />
    <Typography>Are you sure you want to delete this user?</Typography>
    <ButtonSet>
        <Button>Cancel</Button>
        <Button type="danger">Delete</Button>
    </ButtonSet>
</Playground>
