# Getting Started

## Installation

The One Design System by Clarity Hub uses React and Emotion to render components
and CSS. These are peer dependencies, so you will need to install them seperately
from the design system:

```
npm i --save @clarityhub/one
npm i --save react react-dom prop-types @emotion/core @emotion/styled
```

## Initialize Styleguide

This will normalize your css and load in webfonts from Google.

```js
import '@clarityhub/one/init';
```

## Icons

The prefered icon set to use is the one provided by Material UI:

```
npm i --save @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
```

These are not marked as peerDependencies since they are not actually
required to get the One Design System to run.
