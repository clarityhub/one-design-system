# Getting Started

The **Unity Design System** is broken into multiple packages to make it easier to work with depending on your use-case.

## Installation

### unity-core

The unity-core packages contains colors, typography, spacing, and other utilities that can be used in any JavaScript environment.

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-core
```

### unity-web

The unity-core package uses React and Emotion to render components
and CSS. These are peer dependencies, so you will need to install them seperately
from the design system:

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-web
npm i --save react react-dom prop-types @emotion/core @emotion/styled
```

### unity-email

The unity-email package is for generating HTML emails from React.

```bash
npm i --save @clarityhub/unity-email
```

## Initialize Styleguide

This will normalize your css and load in webfonts from Google.

```js
import '@clarityhub/unity-web/lib/init';
```

Simply use the above line in your entrypoint of your application (usually `index.js`).

## Icons

The prefered icon set to use is the one provided by Material UI:

```bash
npm i --save @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons
```

These are not marked as peerDependencies since they are not actually
required to get the One Design System to run.
