# Spacing

## Spacing utility

```js
import spacing from '@clarityhub/unity-core/lib/spacing';
```

These spacing constants are meant to be used as REM multipliers.

They also double in size on purpose to have the distances be extreme
enough that they are perceptable.

Example usage:

```css
margin: ${spacing.xsmall}rem;
```
