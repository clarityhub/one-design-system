# Notification

The notification component can be used to display contextual user messages.

```js
import Notification from '@clarityhub/unity-web/lib/components/Notification';
```

## Basic Notifications

Notifications come in various theme colors

<Playground>
  <Notification type="danger">
      There were problems with processing your
      request. We encountered the following issues:
      <ul>
          <li>Our servers are offline</li>
      </ul>
  </Notification>
  <br />
  <Notification type="primary">
      Welcome to Clarity Hub, we've updated our Terms and Conditions
  </Notification>
  <br />
  <Notification type="success">
      Congratulations, you've enabled your first integration!
  </Notification>
</Playground>

## Thin Notifications

The padding on notifications can be reduced to create thin notifications.

<Playground>
  <Notification variant="thin" type="danger">
      There were problems with processing your
      request. We encountered the following issues:
      <ul>
          <li>Our servers are offline</li>
      </ul>
  </Notification>
  <br />
  <Notification variant="thin" type="primary">

  </Notification>
  <br />
  <Notification variant="thin" type="success">
      Congratulations, you've enabled your first integration!
  </Notification>
</Playground>

### Dismissable Notifications

You can use the Dismissable interaction to create dismissable notifications.

<Playground>
  <Dismissable>
    {({ Dismiss }) => (
      <Notification
        type="danger"
        variant="block"
      >
        <Dismiss />
        There were problems with processing your
        request. We encountered the following issues:
        <ul>
            <li>Our servers are offline</li>
