# Blockquote

Use blockquotes to show that text was taken from another source.

```js
import Blockquote from '@clarityhub/unity-web/lib/components/Blockquote';
```

## Example

<Playground>
    <Typography>
        Normal paragraph text. Notice the alignment of the blockquote is
        to the left of the paragraph.
    </Typography>
    <Blockquote>
        <Typography>This is a block quote with some text</Typography>
        <Typography>There can be multiple paragraphs</Typography>
    </Blockquote>
</Playground>

## Prop Types

Blockquote will pass through all props to the blockquote element.

<PropsTable of={Blockquote} />
